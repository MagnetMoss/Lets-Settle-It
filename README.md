# Lets-Settle-It
Conflict Resolution App for indecisive people.
<!-- In progress -->


Description
Let's Settle It Conflict Resolution App is an application for the usage of randomly selecting the thing which you would like to do. Specifically, current development includes options for movie selection, activity selection and a custom input in which you can have the app select between options you yourself have chosen.

Usage
So imagine this, you and your significant other are in a conversation and you both know that you want to go out and do something. But you can't agree on where to go, or maybe you both want to get some Netflix and Chill going on but you can't decide on a movie. Look no further, by using this app's random selector, you'll be able to quickly select a movie by genre and year range then put that movie on and get to the good stuff. This is accomplished by:

Use of the OMDB API to randomly select a movie from their entire database
You can see results displayed by Genre
You can see results displayed by Type(i.e. movie, show, etc.)
You can see results displayed by Year range(i.e. 2000-2010)

Or you can  insert a custom input to spin the Wheel of Destiny.

Comparing to Pokemon GO
The main idea behind this application is offering you a decision when you can't make one. This idea is so versatile future development could include a plethora of options. But at the base level it is a random selector. It has many facets, for example, resolving a couple's conversation about where to eat, or when the boys get together and can't decide which club to go to. Please enjoy using our app.
