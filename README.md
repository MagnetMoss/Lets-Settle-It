# Lets-Settle-It
Conflict Resolution App for indecisive people.
<!-- In progress -->


Description
Let's Settle It Conflict Resolution App is an application for the usage of randomly selecting the thing which you would like to do. Specifically, current development includes options for movie selection, activity selection and a custom input in which you can have the app select between options you yourself have chosen.

Usage
So imagine this, you and your significant other are in a conversation and you both know that you want to go out and do something. But you can't agree on where to go, or maybe you both want to get some Netflix and Chill going on but you can't decide on a movie. Look no further, by using this app's random selector, you'll be able to quickly select a movie by genre and year range then put that movie on and get to the good stuff. This is accomplished by:

Use of the OMDB API to randomly select a movie from their entire database
You can search by Genre
Search Pokemon by Type(i.e. movie, show, etc.)
Search Pokemon by Year range(i.e. 2000-2010)

Or you can search for an activity to do by spinning the Wheel of Destiny

Comparing to Pokemon GO
The main idea behind this application is so that you can compare the list of Pokemon you just searched and see if it is available in Pokemon GO. To do this all you need to do is search for a Pokemon using any of the filters above and then pressing the Pokemon GO button. This will change the names of the Pokemon on screen from black to either green for available or red for unavailable.
